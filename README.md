Language - C++ - mostly C + standard template library 

## When you encounter barrier
* Don't panic
* Stop and think - identify your actual problem 
* Use internet
* Try and error
* Always make progress
    * understand a bit better what is your problem is progress
    * gathered more assistance is progress 
    * Tried and failed that's a progress (if you learn something from the try)
        * IMPORTANT always learn something from your fail -- Fail and THINK
    * Know when to call help -- crucial

## Setting up your environment
### We are using windows
#### We need command line interface
* WSL 
```
$ mkdir usaco-2022
$ cd usaco-2022  [use TAB for auto completion] 
$ vim hello.cpp
$ ls
$ g++ hello.cpp -o hello
$ ./hello
Hello!
```
* Code editor
   * vim / emacs
   * nano
   * vscode
* Source code - e.g. `hello.cpp`
* Compiler - `g++`.   hello.cpp -> executable binary

## Goals
1. Hello world -- setting up your work flow, to the point without thinking within a minute 
2. Complete the bronze in a week
3. Complete the bronze in 3-hours 
4. Complete the bronze in 30min each
5. Move on to silver (staring at goal 3) shifting toward 1-bronze a warm-up
